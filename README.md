# Project Sign@Me - (read as Sign - at - me)

This project is a Sign Language Translator Application that uses a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model, converted from a trained YOLOv8n model.  
The application can recognize and translate **sign language gestures**, including:
- 📖 Alphabets (A–Z)  
- 🗨️ Basic Filipino words  
- 🌍 English Greeting words  

Its primary goal is to reduce language barriers and enhance communication between signers and non-signers.
